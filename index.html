              >My Journey into Software Development</a
            >
            <p>
              Becoming a software developer is an exciting journey that can lead
              to a rewarding career. However, it can also be challenging,
              especially for those without formal training or experience.
              Pursuing a career in software development has been a blessing and
              an eye-opener for me. Joining Pursuit has giving me the structure
              and push I needed to succeed. Pursuit Fellowship is a highly
              selective, rigorous, and ISA program that trains individuals from
              underserved communities to become software engineers. The program
              is designed to provide participants with the technical skills,
              professional development, and community support they need to
              succeed in the tech industry. What have I been Learning? So far I
              learned about Javascript, HTML and CSS. Mostly doing research and
              how to solve problems on my own. That no matter what you can find
              the answer.

            <p>
              Learning JavaScript can be a valuable skill for anyone interested
              in web development or software engineering. JavaScript is a
              programming language that is commonly used to create interactive
              and dynamic web pages. To start learning JavaScript, it's
              essential to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Once you
              have a foundation in these languages, you can begin to learn
              JavaScript's syntax and concepts, such as variables, functions,
              and loops. There are many online resources available for learning
              JavaScript, including tutorials, courses, and documentation. Some
              popular websites for learning JavaScript include Codecademy,
              Udemy, and FreeCodeCamp. With consistent practice and dedication,
              anyone can become proficient in JavaScript and use it to create
              engaging and dynamic web applications.
